Hi! I’m a final year MBATech student at NMIMS with a BTech in IT and MBA in Technology Management, specialising in Finance.

As a passionately curious individual, I am an avid follower of our financial markets, cryptocurrencies, geopolitics and their implications among other things. I take active effort to become better tomorrow than I am today and am wholehearted about whatever it is I do - I really want to create value wherever it is I go!

I’m well versed with macros and VBA in Excel, PowerBI - DAX, basic SQL, Python programming and Tableau. I’m currently learning more about R and hope to master that soon.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to podcasts, watching movies, reading memoirs and participating at Model UN conferences.

I look forward to making a career in finance, through global markets or consulting.
